# Bouncing Ball
This simulation was for the first assignment. The assignment was to render a ball (an ellipse) on the canvas, make it move, and make sure it bounces off the sides of the canvas.
Furthermore you were allowed to challenge yourself and add a couple more things. I decided I wanted to add Gravity, Collision between the balls, and the freedom to render as many balls as you would want.

Implemented:
- Canvas
- Balls
- Movement
- Wall collision
- Gravity
- An environment variable that determines how many balls are created

To do:
- Object collision
- In-browser settings pane
